# Algorithms-and-Programming-Homework3

Write a program that takes an integer value (n) from the user and randomly generates n x n game board with three letters
(A, B and C) and then finds the longest consecutive sequence of the same letter horizontally.
If more than one sequences have the same maximum length, you can print only one of them.

Examples:
Input: 12
AAABCCCCACCB
BBABCCCDACCC
CCCCCABAAACC
ABABCCCAAABB
CABBBBBBBBBA
AAAACBCBBBCC
CCBABACCCCCC
AAAABBBABABC
BBBBAACCACCC
BCACABCABABC
BABBBACBABCA
BCABBCABCABA
Output: B length=9

Input: 8
AABCBCBC
BCABCAAA
BCCCCCCC
BBBCCBCC
AACBCCAB
AACBBBCC
BCABCABB
BBCACABA
Output: C length=7
